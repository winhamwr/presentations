# why? #

* building things nobody cares about
* SUCKS
* the ultimate waste

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# we are not omniscient #

* we're bad at prediction
* anyone who says otherwise is selling something
* startups are fundamentally uncertain (by definition)

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# give up? #

* business plans don't survive customer contact
* "be a no-planning cowboy!?"
* if you're ok with never learning

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# analogy.rocket_ships #

* exact thrusts, vectors, weights
* meticulous planning up-front
* tiny errors in planning can compound to produce catastrophies

# analogy.driving #

* steering a car is easy
* describe the specific motions for your commute?
* impossible
* feedback loops!

!SLIDE 
# build #

* create your MVP

!SLIDE 
# measure  #

* quantitatively or qualitatively

!SLIDE
# learn #

* analyze what you measured
* this is where the magic happens

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# planning happens in reverse #

* what do you want to validate? *Learn*
* what data would change your belief? *Measure*
* what must you do to gather that data? *Build*

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# case studies #

* stolen from The Lean Startup
* Intuit's Snaptax
* Zappos

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Snaptax #

* Started in 2009 as an internal Intuit project
* 350k users in 2011

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Snaptax: assumptions #

* people want to use their W2 to start tax returns via their fax/scanner

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Snaptax: rocketship #

* spend millions to develop application for entering W2 info via fax/scanner
* write versions for all 50 states
* develop marketing plan for big launch with nationwide billboards and tv ads

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Snaptax: BML part 1 #

* talked to actual customers before building *gasp*
* MVP was a quick survey
* people didn't know how to use scanners/fax
* people wanted their entire return completed automatically

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Snaptax: BML part 2 #

* **build**- build a smartphone app using CA rules for simplest returns
* **measure**- who actually downloads and submits their 1040-EZ?
* **learn**- are there people willing to use their phone to file returns at all?

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Zappos #

* online clothing retailer known for great customer service
* over $1 billion in revenue
* acquired by Amazon for $1.2 billion

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Zappos: assumptions #

* frustrated that there was no central online place to buy shoes
* assumed that customers would buy online for a superior retail experience

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Zappos: rocketship #

* build distribution infrastucture
* aquire partners (Nike, Adidas, etc)
* plan large sales/marketing launch

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# Zappos: BML #

* **build**- take pictures of local merchants shoes, put them online, buy at full price and ship by hand
* **measure**- who actually buys? what do they buy? what are their concerns?
* **learn**- price affected perception. returns are very important.

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# so many examples #

* media loves the big-bang visionary story
* it's a *lie*
* **flickr**- video game
* **groupon**- social activism platform
* **google**- just info on Stanford and Linux

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# tactics #

* individual tactics are not the BML strategy, but
* tactics that get you through the loop faster, better

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# summary #

* be a car, not a rocketship
* use the BML loop to steer
* lower latency through the loop, more learning

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# tactics addendum: A/B testing #

* a specific tactic to aid measurement during experiments

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# tactics addendum: A/B testing #

* aids analysis for questions like:
* what call to action is most compelling to potential customers?

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# A/B testing: call to action experiment  #

* randomly divide potential customers as groups A and B
* show group A "double your sales force"
* show group B "halve your sales cost"
* measure conversions (signups, demos, whatever)

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# tactics addendum: multivariate testing #

* more complex or overlapping A/B tests- multivariate tests
* "which of these 7 options are best?"
* requires higher volume for statistical significance
* if possible, stick to A/B tests for clarity (you'll know when it's not possible)
