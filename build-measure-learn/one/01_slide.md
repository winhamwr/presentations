# what is BML loop? #

* core of Lean Startup
* tool to (in)validate hypothosis
* scientific method for businesses

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# why? #

* building things nobody cares about
* SUCKS
* the ultimate waste

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# we are not omniscient #

* we're bad at prediction
* anyone who says otherwise is selling something
* startups are fundamentally uncertain

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# give up? #

* business plans fail, so no planning
* -be a no-planning cowboy!

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# analogy: rocket ships #

* meticulous planning up-front
* tiny errors compound to produce catastrophies

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# analogy: driving #

* steering a car is easy
* describe the specific motions to get to work?
* impossible
* feedback loops!

!SLIDE 
# don't be a rocket ship #

* space or bust?
* mostly bust

!SLIDE 
# build #

* create your MVP

!SLIDE 
# measure  #

* quantitatively or qualitatively

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# learn #

* analyze what you measured
* this is where the magic happens

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# planning happens in reverse #

* what do you want to validate? *Learn*
* what data would change your belief? *Measure*
* what must you do to gather that data? *Build*

# case studies #

* stolen from The Lean Startup
* Consumer Federal Protection Bureau (CFPB)
* Intuit's Snaptax
* Zappos

# so many examples #

* media loves the big-bang visionary story
* **flickr**: video game
* **groupon**: social activism platform
* **google**: just info on Stanford and Linux

# tactics #

* individual tactics are not the BML strategy, but
* tactics that get you through the loop faster, better

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# summary #

* be a car, not a rocketship
* use the BML-loop to steer
* quicker times through loop, better

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# tactics addendum: A/B testing #

* a specific tactic to aid measurement during experiments
* aids analysis for questions like:
* what call to action is most compelling to potential customers?
* more complex or overlapping A/B tests- multivariate tests

!SLIDE bullets incremental
# call to action experiment  #

* randomly divide potential customers in to groups A and B
* show group A "double your sales force"
* show group B "halve your sales cost"
* measure conversions (signups, demos, whatever)
