# Testing for Pythonistas: nose and pytest

Idiomatic python loathes "just because" classes
and excessive boilerplate,
but the unittest module
would feel at home in Java land.
Nose and pytest to the rescue!
These two frameworks
share a history
and support powerful,
no-boilerplate testing.
Following the "batteries included"
pythonic philosophy,
they also support loads of
use-them-when-you-need-them
features and plugins.

After some history and comparisons,
we'll write and run
our first hassle-free test.
Then we'll take a whirlwind tour
of some of the most powerful features
of nose and pytest,
including test generators,
powerful test selection,
and debugging options.
Finally,
we'll leverage the rich plugin ecosystem
to solve some testing problems
commonly encountered in real-world projects.
