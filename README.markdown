# Wes's Presentations

These are my [showoff](http://github.com/schacon/showoff) presentation.

## Running presentations locally

    @@@ bash
    $ sudo gem install showoff
    $ git clone git://github.com/winhamwr/presentations.git
    $ export PRESO_NAME=build-measure-learn
    $ cd presentations/$PRESO_NAME
    $ showoff serve

Or, you can run it via rack (e.g., using Passenger) by just installing the showoff gem
and pointing to the rackup file (config.ru).

## Hosted Version

There is also a hosted version running at:

[http://weswinham.com/preso/indylsc-build-measure-learn/](http://weswinham.com/preso/indylsc-build-measure-learn/)

## Deploying presentations to your blog (Wes)

Use the nifty `deploy-to-blog.sh` script!

## Thanks and stuff
