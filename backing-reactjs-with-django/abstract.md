# Backing ReactJS with Django

React is Facebook's increasingly-popular javascript library
for building user interfaces.
It is architecturally quite different from competitors
and proponents tout it's ability to limit UI complexity creep.
As an added advantage,
it also works for writing native mobile apps.

This talk will cover:

* Why React is a large step forward
* How to back React with django-rest-framework
* How to incrementally integrate React into an existing Django project
* Solution to common configuration and deployment problems
